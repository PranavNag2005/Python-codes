For numbers, the `+` operator works as a mathematical operator:\n```python\nx = 5\ny = 10\nprint(x + y)  # Output: 15\n```\nIf you try to combine a string and a number with the `+` operator, Python will give you an error:\n```python\nx = 5\ny = \"John\"\nprint(x + y)  # This will raise a TypeError\n```\nThe best way to output multiple variables in the `print()` function is to separate them with commas, which supports different data types:\n```python\nx = 5\ny = \"John\"\nprint(x, y)  # Output: 5 John\n```"
